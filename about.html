<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an engineering student with a deep interest in web development. From an early stage in my academic journey, I discovered a passion for creating digital experiences and understanding how websites and web applications function. This interest led me to pursue web development seriously, and I have been committed to learning and improving my skills in this field. </p>

<p>As part of my learning journey, I have been working on mastering the core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These form the foundation of all modern websites, and I enjoy using them to build clean and responsive user interfaces. I have also started exploring popular frontend frameworks like React, which allow me to create more interactive and efficient web applications</p>



<p>In addition to frontend development, I am also learning the basics of backend technologies, including working with databases, servers, and APIs. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, capable of handling both the client-side and server-side of web projects. I believe that understanding both ends of web development gives me a better perspective on how to build complete and functional websites.

  Beyond coding, I am passionate about problem-solving and continuously pushing myself to learn new things. I enjoy working on personal projects, collaborating with others, and participating in coding challenges that help me grow as a developer. In the future, I hope to contribute to meaningful projects and be part of a team that builds innovative web solutions.</p>
